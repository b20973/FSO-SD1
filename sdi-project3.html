    <h2>Project 2</h2>

<p>A hobby of mine that I enjoy just as much as sand gardening is attending local film festivals. When the Cleveland International Film Fest comes to town, my friends and I always try to buy our tickets in advance. Purchasing a package ahead of time ensures two things, getting them at a better rate and avoiding sold out shows.</p>
<p> Purchasing my tickets in advance also gives me the opportunity to "make a night" out of it. Touring downtown Cleveland and checking out new restaurants and bars makes the occasion a bit more special.</article>
