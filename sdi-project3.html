<p>This week I chose to change my story up a bit. The story I used last week didn't really progress much at all.</p>
<p>In this weeks story I'm describing something I do fairly often, which is "hunting for river rocks", I have a sand garden in my yard. Pulling rocks from nature is a cheap way to get that sense of nature right in my own space! With that said I hope everyone enjoys my short story.</article>
